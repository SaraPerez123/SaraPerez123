- 👋 Hi, I’m @SaraPerez123
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related with basics of coding, JavaScript, and general programing beginner friendly knowledge. When not infront of a screen, I am a bit obsessed with fungi. I love gardening, nature and camping trips.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. I decided changing careers and I'm at the beggining of an exciting path. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any proyect that I will learn from. Sharing knowledge, help each other. 
- 📫 How to reach me, drop me a message, I don't know yet how but sure there is somewhere around here where you can text me.
- Happy coding!
